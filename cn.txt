1) Share a Folder from a PC Connected to LAN

Objective:
To share resources like files/folders among multiple computers connected within a LAN.

Procedure (Windows):

i)Right-click on the folder → Select Properties → Sharing tab.

ii)Click Share, add users, and set permissions (Read/Write).

iii)A shared network path like \ComputerName\SharedFolder is created.

iv)Other PCs on the same LAN can access it via:

v)Ensure all PCs are in the same workgroup and have the same IP subnet.

Purpose:
Enables quick file sharing, backup, and collaboration in a LAN without using removable drives.

i. Compare Straight and Cross Cable

Straight-Through Cable:

Same pin configuration on both ends (T568A ↔ T568A or T568B ↔ T568B)

Used to connect different devices (PC–Switch, Switch–Router)

Transmit and receive pins remain the same

Common in office LAN setups

Cross-Over Cable:

One end T568A, other end T568B

Used to connect similar devices (PC–PC, Switch–Switch)

Transmit connects to receive

Often replaced by Auto-MDIX in modern NICs

ii. Applications & Specifications of UTP Cat-5 Cable

Full Form: Unshielded Twisted Pair, Category 5
Structure: 4 twisted pairs (8 copper wires) + RJ-45 connector
Frequency: 100 MHz
Speed: Up to 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet)
Maximum Length: 100 meters
Applications:

Ethernet LAN (10Base-T, 100Base-TX)

Telephone and CCTV systems

Connecting PCs, switches, routers
Advantages: Inexpensive, flexible, easy to install, low signal loss

iii. Difference Between Switch and Hub

Hub:

Works on OSI Layer 1 (Physical)

Broadcasts data to all ports

No intelligence, shared bandwidth

More collisions, slower

Used in small or old networks

Switch:

Works on OSI Layer 2 (Data Link)

Sends data only to target MAC address

Maintains MAC table

Dedicated bandwidth, faster, more secure

Used in modern LANs

iv. Discuss PICT LAN Structure

Example (PICT or your college):

Star topology using managed switches

CAT-6 UTP cables for connection

Central router connecting departments and internet

Servers: DHCP, DNS, FTP, Web, and Mail

IP Scheme: Private IPs (192.168.x.x) assigned by DHCP

Firewall ensures network security

Wi-Fi access points for wireless coverage

Advantages:
High speed, easy fault detection, centralized control

v. Explain & Compare Network Topologies

Bus Topology:

All nodes share one backbone cable

Simple and cheap

Single cable failure breaks entire network

Star Topology:

All devices connect to a central switch

Reliable, scalable, easy to manage

Switch failure affects all devices

Ring Topology:

Each node connected to two others forming a loop

Predictable performance

Break affects entire ring

Mesh Topology:

Each node connected to every other node

High reliability, no single point of failure

Expensive and complex wiring

Hybrid Topology:

Combination of two or more topologies

Flexible, scalable

Complex design and maintenance

Commonly used topology: Star

vi. Find Details of the NIC from Your System

Linux: ifconfig or ip addr

Details Displayed:

Adapter Name (e.g., Intel Ethernet Adapter)

MAC Address (Physical Address)

IP Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway

DHCP and DNS information

Purpose:
Helps identify network hardware and troubleshoot issues.

2) Execute Network Commands

i. Check hostname:
Command: hostname
Description: Displays local system name

ii. Get IP address:
Command: ipconfig
Description: Shows IP, subnet mask, and gateway

iii. Get adapter details:
Command: ipconfig /all
Description: Displays MAC, DHCP, and DNS information

iv. Check connectivity:
Command: ping <IP>
Description: Sends ICMP echo request to test connection

v. Find route details:
Command: tracert <IP>
Description: Displays hops between source and destination

vi. Get data delivery stats:
Command: pathping <IP>
Description: Shows packet loss and route performance

vii. Check ARP cache:
Command: arp -a
Description: Displays IP–MAC mappings

viii. Check active connections:
Command: netstat -an
Description: Lists TCP/UDP connections and listening ports

3) Use Protocol Analyzer to Capture and Analyze ARP Packets

i. ARP Packet Format

Hardware Type

Protocol Type

Hardware Length

Protocol Length

Operation (Request/Reply)

Sender MAC and IP

Target MAC and IP

ii. ARP Operation

Host A broadcasts “Who has IP 192.168.1.2?”

Host B replies “192.168.1.2 is at MAC 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E”

Both update their ARP cache for faster communication

Wireshark Filter: arp

iii. Display Flow Graph
In Wireshark: Statistics → Flow Graph
Shows ARP Request → ARP Reply exchange between two hosts.

4) Capture & Analyze PING & TRACERT Packets

i. Capture Filter
Used before capture to record specific packets.
Examples:
icmp – captures only ping packets
host 192.168.1.5 – captures specific host traffic

ii. Display Filter
Used after capture to display filtered packets.
Examples:
icmp – shows only ping packets
ip.addr == 192.168.1.2 – shows traffic to/from one host

iii. ICMP Operation
Used for network diagnostics and control messages.
Ping uses Echo Request/Reply.
Traceroute uses Time Exceeded messages.

iv. ICMP Error Reporting Messages

Destination Unreachable

Time Exceeded

Redirect Message

Parameter Problem

Source Quench (deprecated)

5) Capture TCP Stream using Wireshark

i. Concept of TCP Stream
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable delivery.
In Wireshark: Right-click → Follow → TCP Stream

ii. TCP Header Fields

Source Port

Destination Port

Sequence Number

Acknowledgment Number

Header Length

Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.)

Window Size

Checksum

Urgent Pointer

iii. TCP Three-Way Handshake

SYN – Client initiates connection

SYN + ACK – Server acknowledges

ACK – Client confirms, connection established

6) Configure FTP Server and Client Communication

Ports Used:

Control: 21

Data: 20

Client Command: ftp <server IP>

i. Active and Passive FTP Sessions

Active FTP:

Client initiates control connection

Server initiates data connection (port 20)

May be blocked by firewalls

Passive FTP:

Client initiates both control and data connections

Works better behind firewalls

ii. Classification of Logical Ports

0–1023: Well-known ports (HTTP 80, FTP 21, Telnet 23)
1024–49151: Registered ports (custom apps)
49152–65535: Dynamic/private ports (temporary client ports)

iii. Applications of FTP

Uploading/downloading website files

Software updates

Data backup and large file transfers

7) Web Server Configuration and Communication

i. HTTP and WWW
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) defines communication between web client and server.
WWW (World Wide Web) is the system of hyperlinked web pages accessed using HTTP.

ii. Significance of index.html
Default home page automatically loaded by web browsers when a directory is opened.

iii. Port Numbers
HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443 (secure via SSL/TLS)

8) Telnet Server Configuration and Remote Logging

Port: 23
Command: telnet <server IP>
Purpose: Remote login and command execution on another system.

Wireshark Observation:
Captured login details (username and password) appear as plain text.

Comment on Security:
Telnet is insecure because it transmits data unencrypted.
SSH (Secure Shell) is preferred for secure remote access.

9) DHCP Server Configuration

ii. Four-Step DHCP Operation

Discover – Client broadcasts for IP

Offer – Server offers available IP

Request – Client requests offered IP

Acknowledge – Server confirms IP lease

iii. Broadcast Communication
Clients have no IP initially; broadcasts ensure servers receive the request.

iv. DHCP Relay Agent
Forwards DHCP messages between clients and servers on different networks or subnets.

v. DHCP Lease Process

IP assigned for limited duration (lease)

Client renews before expiry

Check status using: ipconfig /all

10) Packet Tracer Network with 2 PCs, 2 Switches, 3 Routers

Steps:

Connect devices using straight cables.

Assign IP addresses to all interfaces.

Configure routing manually or use RIP.

Verify with ping command between PCs.

Explanation:
Packets travel PC1 → Switch1 → Router1 → Router2 → Router3 → Switch2 → PC2.
If routes are configured properly, ping replies confirm connectivity.
